# Callendar-Van Dussen Coefficient Calculator
Calendar van dussen coefficient calculator. Calculate coefficient A B C from calibration data of temperature and resistance.

# Usage
Download from release page, unzip. Double click on cvd.exe, enter data as prompt.
Prompt question :
1. "Enter the number of calibration data points (do not include the resistance at 0°C, will be asked later):" -> total calibration data you have excluding value at 0 deg C (RTPW). example : 3 or 5 or 6
2. "Enter the temperatures and corresponding resistances:" -> your calibration data (do not enter data at 0 deg C), temperature first then space then resistance. example : 49.824 119.98
3. "Enter the resistance at 0°C (R0): " -> resistance value at 0 deg c. example : 100
